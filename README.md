# Lyra

A port of https://github.com/ArminKleinert/Lyra from Ruby to D.  
My hope is that this will make for a big performance improvement and maybe help out with future projects where a statically typed language has to be used for implementing a dynamically typed language.  

Luckily, most functions were implemented in Lyra itself, lessening the workload of porting it.  

Development on this port will be slow because life is a thing.
